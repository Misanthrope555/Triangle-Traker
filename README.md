## Description
github repository :https://github.com/Misanthrope555/Triangle-Traker
gh-page :https://https://misanthrope555.github.io/Triangle-Traker/
This webapp is designed to help a user check which type of triangle it is according to the dimensions he/she has input.Irrespective of how big the figures are,the program validates whether the three sides input can form any of the three types of trinagles:Equilateral,isosceles or scalene.

## Behavior Driven Development

| Behavior        |  Input     | Output                        |   
| :-------------: | :--------: | :--------------------------:  |
|  blank input    |  null      |  doesn't make a triangle      |
|                 |            |                               |
|One side is zero |  base=0   |                               |
|                 |  width=3   | doesn't make a triangle       |                 
|                 |  height=4   |                               |
|                 |            |                               |
| Similar inputs  |  base=12  |                               |
|                 |  width=12  | Makes an  equilateral triangle|                 
|                 |  height=12  |                               |
|                 |            |                               |
|Two sides have   |  base=12  |                               |
| similar values  |  width=12  | Makes an  isosceles triangle  |                 
|    value        |  height=7   |                               |
|                 |            |                               |
| Different       |  base=8   |                               |
|   inputs        |  width=6   | Makes a scalene triangle      |                 
|                 |  height=5   |                               |
